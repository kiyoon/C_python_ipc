# C_python_ipc

Author: Kiyoon Kim (https://kiyoon.kim)  

Message Queue based Interprocess Communication (IPC) between Python and C. There are sender and receiver code for each language.  

The senders will send:  
- string
- two doubles
- one array (or numpy)
- one double and one array (or numpy)

And the receivers receive the byte formatted data and unpack.

## Dependencies

- Python >= 3.6
- sysv_ipc (python package) - Only supports Unix (Linux and MacOS), not Windows.
- numpy (python package)

For Python 2 support, see the older version: [v0.1](https://github.com/kiyoon/C_python_ipc/tree/v0.1)

## Usage

Build C programs

`make`

Run receiver. For example, C receiver:

`./receiver`

In a different terminal, execute sender. For example, Python sender with String, double (float64), numpy formats.

`./sender.py`

Watch what happens on the receiver!

## Example output
### sender.py
```console
$ python3 sender.py
string sent: sample string
two doubles sent: 1234.56789, 9876.12345
numpy array sent: [[ 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7]
 [ 8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15]]
one double and numpy array sent: 1234.56789, [[0 1 2 3]
 [4 5 6 7]]
```

### receiver (C)
```console
$ ./receiver
